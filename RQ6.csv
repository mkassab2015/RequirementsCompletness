219,Alrajeh 2012,Generating obstacle conditions for requirements completeness,Yes,,Inductive Logic Programming (ILP),Detecting,ILP is used to learn obstacle conditions from positive and negative examples generated by model checking. It generalizes from specific traces to produce potential obstacles that could prevent goals from being achieved.,Proposed in this paper,
79,Luitel 2023,Using Language Models for Enhancing the Completeness of Natural-Language Requirements,Yes,,BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers),Detecting/Measuring,"The paper uses BERT's masked language model (MLM) to generate contextualized predictions for masked words in requirements. Specifically:

BERT Base model is used (12 encoder layers, hidden size of 768, ~110 million trainable parameters)
Cased model is employed as previous RE research suggests it's preferred for analyzing requirements
Configured to generate multiple predictions per masked word (optimal number determined to be 15)
Used to predict potentially missing terminology in requirements",Referenced,"J. Devlin, M.-W. Chang, K. Lee, and K.

It provides topic loadings for each document, which are used to determine the level of coverage for each topic. This information is then used to assess the completeness of the AUP documents.",Proposed in this paper,

16,Torre 2020,An AI-Assisted Approach for Checking the Completeness of Privacy Policies against GDPR,Yes,,The tool was validated through a case study on 24 unseen privacy policies. It achieved a precision of 85% and recall of 96% in detecting incompleteness issues.,Detecting/Measuring, SVM classifiers are used to predict level-1 and level-2 metadata types in privacy policy sentences. The classifiers are trained on sentence embeddings derived from pre-trained GloVe word vectors.,Proposed in this paper,
